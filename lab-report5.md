The less command by default is used to view the content of a file without having to print it all to the terminal. Once you’re done viewing the file content, you can exit simply by pressing ‘q’ on keyboard. 

3 Alternate features of the less command

less <filename> command with the option -X  
Shows the file content as normal with the exception of leaving the content on the terminal when you exit by pressing ‘q’
